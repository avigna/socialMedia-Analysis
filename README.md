# twitter-analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this public repository is to do collection and analysis of Twitter data.
In the current version, the repository consists uniquely on scripts that search and save Tweets in .jsonl format. 
For that we will need to install one of the following two packages:
  - [Twarc2](https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/twarc2/): this package, which we suggest to use as default, need to be installed in order to make Tweet queries using the shell script /twitter-analysis/scripts/twarcScript.sh.
  - [searchtweets-v2](https://pypi.org/project/searchtweets-v2/): alternatively, this package can be installed to make Tweet queries using the python scripts in /twitter-analysis/scripts/searchtweets/. However, it has been proven to be less reliable than other packages, and might be soon deprecated and deleted. For now, we keep it as an alternative.

Additionally, the file /twitter-analysis/scripts/readJsonlFiles.ipynb is a jupyter notebook to make quick searches and queries through any .jsonl file.

## Queries: basics and resources
This repository was created following the release of Twitter's [Academic Research product track](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research).
The main advantage or the Academic Research product track is that you get full access to archival data. 
It seems that it includes deleted and private tweets, but an official reference is needed to backup this statement.
While this is a powerful tool and gives access to a lot of data, the main problem with it is that it comes under [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access).
Twitter API v2 will eventually be a great tool, but it is currently under developement.
This means that a lot of the resources, tools and syntax that are commonly used in v1 are, currently, either not as robuts or not accessible at all.
This might eventually be addressed by the developers, but it currently results in a warning for any user using this repository and any reference to resources based on v1.

### Basics
Tweet searches, like most other searches and query services, and arguably most of modern computing, rely on the foundations of [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra).
Boolean algebra uses operators AND, OR and NOT.
These operators have a special syntax in Twarc.
Some examples of a query, which will be in quote marks, are the following:

1. The AND operator is included as a space, so the query "Kendrick AND Lamar" should be written as "Kendrick Lamar" or "(Kendrick) (Lamar)". Moreover, the parenthesis serve to cluster or isolate each element of the query, which is particularly useful for long queries.
2. The OR operator is included literally and in caps, so the query "Superman or Batman" should be written as "Superman OR Batman" and, for better readibility "(Superman) OR (Batman)".
3. The NOT operator in included as a dash, so the query "NOT happy"should be written as "-(happy)".
4. Queries have to be composed of 1,024 characters or less.


EXAMPLE 1: 

#### Query: "(Kendrick OR Lamar) (Compton) -(BLM)" 

should look for tweets that include the words "Kendrick" or "Lamar" and the word "Compton" but not the acronym "BLM".

The use of quote marks is very important in queries and needs to be correctly implemented to work in the current version of the /twitter-analysis/scripts/twarcScript.sh shell script. As shown in Ex. 1, the main query uses quote marks. However, the use of quote marks is useful to make string queries.


EXAMPLE 2: 

#### Query: "(\\"Kendrick Lamar\\" OR \\"Kanye West\\" OR \\"Jay-Z\\")"

should look tweets that look for full phrases containing "Kendrick Lamar", "Kanye West" or "Jay-Z", and will avoid spelling correction. Note that, given that these phrases are inside the main-query quotation marks, any additional quotation marks that pile-up words need to have an inverted dash before the straight double commas. In other words, avoid any weirdly formatted, e.g., curly, quotation marks. Remember that all characters, but the main-query quotation marks, count in the 1,024 character limit for a search query.

There are additional Twitter search operators that can be used for specific purposes.

EXAMPLE 3:

#### Query: "(\\"Kendrick Lamar\\") (lang:es) (place_country:US) (-is:retweet)"

should look for full phrases containing "Kendrick Lamar", that Twitter has classified to be in Spanish and located in the US, and that are not retweets.

EXAMPLE 4:

#### Query: "(\\"Kendrick Lamar\\" OR \\"Kanye West\\" OR \\"Jay-Z\\") (üòç OR üòò) (lang:es) (place_country:MX) (-is:retweet)"

### Resources
[Learn twarc](https://scholarslab.github.io/learn-twarc/): mostly for v1, but some overlap with v2. Hopefully a complete and robust documentation for v2 soon.

https://twittercommunity.com/: forums of users discussing their experiences, questions, and solutions while data mining on Twitter.

[Search Tweets](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/introduction): Twitter Developer official "get started" on how to search Tweets.

[Rules and Filtering](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/enterprise/rules-and-filtering/operators-by-product): rules and filters that are available for the Enterprise version of Twitter. Most of them probably work on Twarc2 with the Academic Research product track, or at least they don't throw an error. This is a very good resource for advanced searches, but, again, beware of compatibility.
