# twitter-analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this public repository is to do collection and analysis of Twitter data.
In the current version, the repository consists uniquely on scripts that search and save Tweets in .jsonl format. 
For that we can use two packages:
  - [searchtweets-v2](https://pypi.org/project/searchtweets-v2/)
  - [Twarc2](https://twarc-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/twarc2/)

## Queries: examples and resources
This repository was created following the release of Twitter's [Academic Research product track](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research).
The main advantage or the Academic Research product track is that you get full access to archival data. 
It seems that it includes deleted and private tweets, but an official reference is needed to backup this statement.
While this is a powerful tool and gives access to a lot of data, the main problem with it is that it comes under [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access).
Twitter API v2 will eventually be a great tool, but it is currently under developement.
This means that a lot of the resources, tools and syntax that are commonly used in v1 are, currently, either not as robuts or not accessible at all.
This might eventually be addressed by the developers, but it currently results in a warning for any user using this repository and any reference to resources based on v1.
